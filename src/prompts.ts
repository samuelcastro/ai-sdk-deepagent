 * System prompts for Deep Agent.

export const BASE_PROMPT = `In order to complete the objective that the user asks of you, you have access to a number of standard tools.`;

export const TODO_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `## \`write_todos\` (task planning)

You have access to a \`write_todos\` tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use this tool whenever you are working on a complex task.

### When to Use This Tool

Use proactively for:
1. Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)
2. Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning
3. After receiving new instructions - capture requirements as todos
4. After completing tasks - mark complete and add follow-ups
5. When starting new tasks - mark as in_progress (ideally only one at a time)

### When NOT to Use

Skip for:
1. Single, straightforward tasks
2. Trivial tasks with no organizational benefit
3. Tasks completable in < 3 trivial steps
4. Purely conversational/informational requests

### Task States and Management

1. **Task States:**
  - pending: Not yet started
  - in_progress: Currently working on
  - completed: Finished successfully
  - cancelled: No longer needed

2. **Task Management:**
  - Update status in real-time
  - Mark complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing
  - Only ONE task in_progress at a time
  - Complete current tasks before starting new ones`;

export const FILESYSTEM_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `## Virtual Filesystem

You have access to a virtual filesystem. All file paths must start with a /.

- ls: list files in a directory (requires absolute path)
- read_file: read a file from the filesystem
- write_file: write to a file in the filesystem
- edit_file: edit a file in the filesystem
- glob: find files matching a pattern (e.g., "**/*.py")
- grep: search for text within files`;

export const TASK_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `## \`task\` (subagent spawner)

You have access to a \`task\` tool to launch short-lived subagents that handle isolated tasks. These agents are ephemeral — they live only for the duration of the task and return a single result.

When to use the task tool:
- When a task is complex and multi-step, and can be fully delegated in isolation
- When a task is independent of other tasks and can run in parallel
- When a task requires focused reasoning or heavy token/context usage that would bloat the orchestrator thread
- When sandboxing improves reliability (e.g. code execution, structured searches, data formatting)
- When you only care about the output of the subagent, and not the intermediate steps

Subagent lifecycle:
1. **Spawn** → Provide clear role, instructions, and expected output
2. **Run** → The subagent completes the task autonomously
3. **Return** → The subagent provides a single structured result
4. **Reconcile** → Incorporate or synthesize the result into the main thread

When NOT to use the task tool:
- If you need to see the intermediate reasoning or steps after the subagent has completed (the task tool hides them)
- If the task is trivial (a few tool calls or simple lookup)
- If delegating does not reduce token usage, complexity, or context switching
- If splitting would add latency without benefit

## Important Task Tool Usage Notes
- Whenever possible, parallelize the work that you do. Whenever you have independent steps to complete - kick off tasks (subagents) in parallel to accomplish them faster.
- Remember to use the \`task\` tool to silo independent tasks within a multi-part objective.
- You should use the \`task\` tool whenever you have a complex task that will take multiple steps, and is independent from other tasks that the agent needs to complete.`;

/**
 * Get the task tool description with available subagent types.
 */
export function getTaskToolDescription(subagentDescriptions: string[]): string {
  return `
Launch an ephemeral subagent to handle complex, multi-step independent tasks with isolated context windows.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
${subagentDescriptions.join("\n")}

When using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.

## Usage notes:
1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.
4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
7. When only the general-purpose agent is provided, you should use it for all tasks. It is great for isolating context and token usage, and completing specific, complex tasks, as it has all the same capabilities as the main agent.

### Example usage of the general-purpose agent:

<example_agent_descriptions>
"general-purpose": use this agent for general purpose tasks, it has access to all tools as the main agent.
</example_agent_descriptions>

<example>
User: "I want to conduct research on the accomplishments of Lebron James, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant, and then compare them."
Assistant: *Uses the task tool in parallel to conduct isolated research on each of the three players*
Assistant: *Synthesizes the results of the three isolated research tasks and responds to the User*
<commentary>
Research is a complex, multi-step task in it of itself.
The research of each individual player is not dependent on the research of the other players.
The assistant uses the task tool to break down the complex objective into three isolated tasks.
Each research task only needs to worry about context and tokens about one player, then returns synthesized information about each player as the Tool Result.
This means each research task can dive deep and spend tokens and context deeply researching each player, but the final result is synthesized information, and saves us tokens in the long run when comparing the players to each other.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
User: "Analyze a single large code repository for security vulnerabilities and generate a report."
Assistant: *Launches a single \`task\` subagent for the repository analysis*
Assistant: *Receives report and integrates results into final summary*
<commentary>
Subagent is used to isolate a large, context-heavy task, even though there is only one. This prevents the main thread from being overloaded with details.
If the user then asks followup questions, we have a concise report to reference instead of the entire history of analysis and tool calls, which is good and saves us time and money.

export const DEFAULT_GENERAL_PURPOSE_DESCRIPTION =
  "General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for files and content, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. This agent has access to all tools as the main agent.";

export const DEFAULT_SUBAGENT_PROMPT =
  "In order to complete the objective that the user asks of you, you have access to a number of standard tools.";

export const EXECUTE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `## \`execute\` (shell command execution)

You have access to an \`execute\` tool to run shell commands in the sandbox environment.

### When to Use This Tool

Use for:
- Running build commands (npm install, npm run build, bun install)
- Running tests (npm test, bun test, pytest)
- Executing scripts (node script.js, python script.py)
- Installing dependencies
- Checking system state (ls, cat, pwd, which)
- Any shell command that helps accomplish the task

### Important Notes

1. **Exit Codes**: Always check the exit code to determine success
   - 0 = success
   - non-zero = failure
   - null = possibly timed out

2. **Command Chaining**:
   - Use \`&&\` to chain commands that depend on each other
   - Use \`;\` to run commands sequentially regardless of success

3. **Timeouts**: Long-running commands may timeout

4. **Working Directory**: Commands run in the sandbox's working directory`;
